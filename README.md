# Flow State Kanban

This app is a fork of the app catalog [Kanban App](https://github.com/RallyApps/app-catalog/tree/master/src/apps/kanban) which adds support for using Flow States as the columns.

**Note: This app is intended to be a short-term solution to the in-product Team Board page not supporting swimlanes and advanced filtering.**

## Usage

When using Flow State for the columns all normally configurable column settings (wip limits, exit agreements, schedule state mapping, etc.) are rendered readonly.  

A project administrator configure the team's flow using the  settings tab of the Team Board page.
